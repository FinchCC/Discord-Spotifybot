# Discord-bot with Spotify semi-integration
A normal musicbot built on the victorian api. Also has the ability to queue songs from spotify playlist, as long as they are public. Which at the time i started coding this
project, was a unique feature and why i even made the bot. As more and more bots have implementet this feature, with better developers behind i have no use in this anymore.
You should therefore not expect it to get update or improved(something this project needs), use this a learning tool instead.





# Important:
As this was speedcoded after the rythm ban, everything is just bodged together and a lot of things should probably be improved. But to get it working you need the victorian
framework which you can get here: https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria

You also need a api key for the spotify playlist search api, which is also free at: https://rapidapi.com/shekhar1000.sc/api/unsa-unofficial-spotify-api

To get it working you can either just add the api keys in the return field of the tokens.cs class or you can add them in the botcfg.txt, which need to be placed in the same folder
as the project and therefor is not the solution of you want to debug it.


Again, please see this as help and not a actual bot, this is and still is a shitty project coded as fast as possible. There are better and free bots out there, 
but this is the only source-code on a bot with spotify playlist searcher.
